# test file for report generation
Pointing model for a virtual telescope. Used for testing of the GPoint reporting.
The base of telescope pointing modelling is as follows:

* record target and actual telescope poitings (where the telescope was commanded to point, and where it actually pointed).

* compute error (alt-az for alt-az mounts, ha-dec for equatorial mounts,..)

* produce a function which from the target coordinates (where the telescope was commanded to point) estimates errors

* add those errors to target coordinates next time you will be observing with the telescope

For telescopes with reasonable error control, pointing error residuals RMS below 10" (arcseconds) is not unusuall. The best telescopes can easily achieve poitings with 1-2 arcseconds RMS.

Vector plots of the errors. The beginning of each vector is unmodelled error, end is residual error (error after appliing model corrections).
