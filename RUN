How to run RTS2
===============

After you compile and install (using make install command, see INSTALL file for
details) RTS2, you need to setup envrioment to run RTS2.

You will find in this directory files rts2.initd, rts2.ini, centrald.example,
services.example and devices.example.

rts2.initd should be copyed to /etc/init.d (cp rts2.initd /etc/init.d/rts2). It
is standart init script for RTS2, targeted to work on Debian systems, but
should work on others.

rts2.ini and *.example files should be copied to /etc/rts2 directory. Those
command should do the job:

mkdir /etc/rts2
cp rts2.ini /etc/rts2
cp centrald.example /etc/rts2/centrald
cp services.example /etc/rts2/services
cp devices.example /etc/rts2/devices

Those files provide you with dummy enviroment, on which you can test
rts2-xfocusc and various other systems. Once you will setup dummy enviroment,
setting up enviroment with real devices will be much easier.

Now start rts2 (as root):

/etc/init.d/rts2 start

Running rts2-mon should bring you list of devices connected to the system.
Running rts2-xfocusc will bring you windows with test camera data. Try to get
familiar with those two tools before you proceed with installing devices.
