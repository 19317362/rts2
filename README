RTS2 - Remote Telescope System, 2nd Version
===========================================

RTS2 is software for a fully autonomous robotic telescope observatory. It takes
care of details necessary for the observatory operation. It keeps care of
closing it when bad weather arrives, opening when weather permits operation.
One of its driving requirements was to provide a modular and flexible
environment, able to control a lot of (quickly changing) devices.

RTS2 provides among other things own selector which autonomously picks targets
for observation, and includes complete bookeeping of the observations.

RTS2 is not:
 - an interactive planetarium
 - a human controlled system for observatory operations - project goal is to
   render obsever (both local and remote) uselless, having observatory directed
   only by software
