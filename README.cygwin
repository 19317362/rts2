Installation of RTS2 on Cygwin

RTS2 can run on Microsoft Windows (R)(TM), using Cygwin enviroment. You can get Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com.

RTS2 takes benefits from Cygwin Unix emulation, which includes select() call
etc. It can be linked with Windows libraries. That enables you to quickly add devices, for which you get only binary
Windows driver, to RTS2.
