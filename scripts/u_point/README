Prerequisites
=============

 python3
 pip3 install astropy
              numpy
	      scipy
	       matplotlib
 libnova (needs to be on LD_PATH as libnova.so)

Hands on
========

Fetch real data and fit them

 cd ~/rts2/scripts/u_point/
 wget http://azug.minpet.unibas.ch/~wildi/mount_data_meteo.txt
 ./u_point.py --toc  --mount-data mount_data_meteo.txt --plot

the output should be similar to:

 --------------------------------------------------------
 fited values:
 C1: horizontal telescope collimation: -339.9976 [arcsec]
 C2: constant azimuth offset         :+1024.7588 [arcsec]
 C3: tipping-mount collimation       :   +3.1370 [arcsec]
 C4: azimuth axis tilt West          : +719.9432 [arcsec]
 C5: azimuth axis tilt North         : +422.3190 [arcsec]
 C6: vertical telescope collimation  : +579.9046 [arcsec]
 C7: gravitational tube bending      :  -85.1722 [arcsec]
 /home/wildi/sw/python/v_point/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scipy/optimize/minpack.py:427: RuntimeWarning: Number of calls to function has reached maxfev = 800.
  warnings.warn(errors[info][0], RuntimeWarning)
  fit projection not converged, status: 5

and the plots appear. Ignore the warning sice it is related
to a gaussian fit. Then do a simulation

  ./u_simulate.py --sigma 0. --aa "-339.99 1024.75 3.13  719.9 422.31 579.9 -85.17" --mount-data test.dat  --step 12
  
and the output should be similar to:

 input parameters
 C1: horizontal telescope collimation: -339.9900 [arcsec]
 C2: constant azimuth offset         :+1024.7500 [arcsec]
 C3: tipping-mount collimation       :   +3.1300 [arcsec]
 C4: azimuth axis tilt West          : +719.9000 [arcsec]
 C5: azimuth axis tilt North         : +422.3100 [arcsec]
 C6: vertical telescope collimation  : +579.9000 [arcsec]
 C7: gravitational tube bending      :  -85.1700 [arcsec]
 end input parameters

and finally fit the simulated data with

 ./u_point.py --toc  --mount-data test.dat

and the output shows the parameters in good agreement

 --------------------------------------------------------
 fited values:
 C1: horizontal telescope collimation: -339.9803 [arcsec]
 C2: constant azimuth offset         :+1031.2422 [arcsec]
 C3: tipping-mount collimation       :   +3.1193 [arcsec]
 C4: azimuth axis tilt West          : +718.4110 [arcsec]
 C5: azimuth axis tilt North         : +422.1173 [arcsec]
 C6: vertical telescope collimation  : +579.8966 [arcsec]
 C7: gravitational tube bending      :  -85.1844 [arcsec]
 /home/wildi/sw/python/v_point/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scipy/optimize/minpack.py:427: RuntimeWarning: Number of calls to function has reached maxfev = 800.
  warnings.warn(errors[info][0], RuntimeWarning)
  fit projection not converged, status: 5

And the simulated plots are as "ugly" as the data.


Status as of 2016-10-08
=======================

I started with astropy and found that there are
differences e.g. between EQ (CIRS) to AltAz
transformations I could not explain nor did
someone on astropy@scipy.org answer.

I developed u_point.py based on libnova and added
later the astropy code for comparison again. There
are still differences and I'd be glad if someone
can point me into the right direction.

The EQ models are not usable yet.

The AltAz model does not always converge. Repeat
the fitting several times to gain confidence. I
observed that fits on simulated data do not
converge. In such cases repeat the data generation.


Main differences to Petr's gpoint
---------------------------------

u_point.py includes meteo data and has Python
bindings for libnova.so, as far as I used it.

Interestingly the AltAz model fits well without
meteo data since the tube droop parameter is
a function of Alt too. But as temperature varies
the model will fail to correct the position.

Adding a different model, e.g. J. Condon (1992)
suggested to use a Fourier transformed function,
can be done easily on the source level, at
least that's my hope.

Getting started with u_point.py
===============================

 cd ~/rts2/scripts/u_point/
 # data set without ... 
 wget http://azug.minpet.unibas.ch/~wildi/mount_data.txt
 # ... with meteo data (yes, it was cold those days)
 wget http://azug.minpet.unibas.ch/~wildi/mount_data_meteo.txt

 # fit AltAz model with libnova
 ./u_point.py --toc --mount-data mount_data.txt 
 ./u_point.py --toc --mount-data mount_data_meteo.txt 

 # fit HAdec model with libnova (same data, not necessarily
 # a realistic result, but it converges).
 ./u_point.py --toc --mount-data mount_data.txt  --fit-eq
 ./u_point.py --toc --mount-data mount_data_meteo.txt --fit-eq

  # fit AltAz model with astropy
 ./u_point.py --toc --mount-data mount_data.txt --astropy
 ./u_point.py --toc --mount-data mount_data_meteo.txt --astropy

Further options: ./u_point.py --help

Format of the coordinates file and units
========================================

On one line:

 date time UTC begin exposure [format iso],
 catalog RA [rad],
 catalog DEC [rad],
 mount position RA [rad],
 mount position DEC [rad],
 [
 exposure time [sec],
 temperature [deg C],
 pressure QFE [hPa],
 humidity [%]
 ]

Mount coordinates are the apparent coordinates as read
at the setting circles, while catalog coordinates are
J2000 (ICRS).
Exposure, temperature, pressure and humidity are optional.
QFE is the pressure at the observatory (not sea level).

Further plans
=============

I saw that pointing models are created with a tool
like astrometry.net. If the CCD's FoV is small this
approach will fail. I'm trying to create a script
which steers the mount, and after a star has been
centered manually, an image is taken and analyzed
e.g. by SExtractor.
