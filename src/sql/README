This directory (and its subdirectories) contains all necessary SQL files and
shell scripts used to create database to hold RTS2 data.

Subdirectories:

* blanks - blank areas, used to populate FLAT targets.

* create - contains script to create database. When you will run in on
  live database, new script tables will be created, old preserved.
  
* drop - contains drop scripts. USE ON LIVE DATABASE (e.g. with data) ON YOUR
  OWN RISK. Please note, that most probably you will drop database
  with all data by running sql scripts in this subdirectory.

* update - contains update scripts. Basicaly you should run scripts in
  create, then scripts in update.

Scripts:

* rts2-builddb - build RTS2 database. Run scripts in create, then in
  update. Populate tables using data in create init_date.sql. Will not
  install to $PREFIX/bin.
