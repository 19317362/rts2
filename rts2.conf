# This is example config file, created for El Arenosillo I.N.T.A observatory (BOOTES1)
# ${Id}
#
# Comments are denoted by # and runs till end of line.
#
# Should be located at $(PREFIX)/etc/rts2.conf, where $(PREFIX) is
# standart prefix, which you pass to ./configure script
#
# Values names and values are separated by =
# Values which are numbers are handled as numbers,
# values which are string are handled in program as string.
#
# So for example if you give name = 123, and rts2 expected, that name
# is string, default will be used (you give name as double)
# Reasonable defaults are build into code. But don't complain, if they
# doesn't fits your need.
# 
# String values can be given at "", but escaping (yet) doesn't work, so don't give
# something like "\ntest".
