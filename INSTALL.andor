Instructions to install Alta Apogee devices
===========================================

For Andor CCDs, you will need to install Andor SDK. You can get one from Andor
(http://www.andor.com) if you ever ordered CCD from them. Andor works in 32bit
as well as 64bit modes.

After installing Andor SDK (please refer to attached manual) and its kernel
driver, verifying that kernel driver is running (lsmod | grep andord). If you
are using xIon, please make sure that you properly set mem=xxxxM to command
line. Also bear in mind that if your system has more then 3 GB of RAM, you need
to set mem=3000M.

Sometimes install script in Andor install 32 bit libraries on 64 bit machine. Either help yourself by overwriting libandor-xx with correct _x86 variant, or ask Petr (<petr@kubanek.net>) for details.

Then you will need to run ./configure from rts2 with --with-andor option:

user@host:~/fliusb/libfli$ cd ~/rts2
user@host:~/rts2$ ./configure --with-andor=$HOME/andor

if Andor SDK unpacks to ~/andor. Please change directory in --with-andor to actual location of Andor SDK directory).

Then run make and (as root) make install. After installing, start rts2-camd-andor. Please see RUN file for details on
that.
