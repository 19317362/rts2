User interface design
=====================

We would like to implement interface for RTS2 in Google Web Toolkit. This
interface shall allow:

- user authentification
- storing user details
- modifing user details

- administrator interface for users

- creating new targes
- change exposure sequence for targets

- accessing observation logs
   - by target
   - by area on the sky
   - by date/night

- accesing state of the instruments
- change changeable values of the instruments
- command instruments


Google web toolkit and RTS2
===========================

There is the full path how GWT client interacts with RTS2. GWT provides RPC,
which are calleble simply from Java on client side - see
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.RemoteProcedureCalls.html
for nice short description. The calls on client (browser) sides behaves as
common Java functions.

On server, RPC is ussually translated to XMLRPC call and this is shipped to
XMLRPCD for processing. XMLRPCD is part of the RTS2 (rts2/src/xmlrpc). It gets
the informations user wants, and returns back reply to server side of GWT
application. The server side of GWT then returns back to browser.

For database access, we would like to stick for a while with the XMLRPC
mechanism, XMLRPCD being used to actually query data from database. There are
two reasons for this rather complicated mechanism:

- we have a lot of functionality of the database (calculation of target height,
  bonus,..) written in RTS2 C++ classes. Duplicating that work in Java for
  direct database access will be a pain.

- for future applications, distributed environment is envisioned. XML-RPC calls
  can be nicely tunneled through HTTP, which is not a case for JDBC.
