<h1>User interface design</h1>

<p>We would like to implement interface for RTS2 in Google Web Toolkit. This
interface shall allow:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="uc/user_authentification.html">user authentification</a></li>
<li><a href="uc/user_change_details.html">Change user details</a></li>
<li>modifing user details</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>administrator interface for users</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>creating new targes</li>
<li>change exposure sequence for targets</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>accessing observation logs
  <ul>
     <li>by target</li>
     <li>by area on the sky</li>
     <li>by date/night</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>accesing state of the instruments</li>
<li>change changeable values of the instruments</li>
<li>command instruments</li>
</ul>


<h2>Google web toolkit and RTS2</h2>

<p>
There is the full path how GWT client interacts with RTS2. GWT provides RPC,
which are calleble simply from Java on client side - see
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.RemoteProcedureCalls.html">GWT doc</a>
for nice short description. The calls on client (browser) sides behaves as
common Java functions.
</p>

<p>
On server, RPC is ussually translated to XMLRPC call and this is shipped to
XMLRPCD for processing. XMLRPCD is part of the RTS2 (rts2/src/xmlrpc). It gets
the informations user wants, and returns back reply to server side of GWT
application. The server side of GWT then returns back to browser.
</p>

<p>
For database access, we would like to stick for a while with the XMLRPC
mechanism, XMLRPCD being used to actually query data from database. There are
two reasons for this rather complicated mechanism:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li> we have a lot of functionality of the database (calculation of target
  height, bonus,..) written in RTS2 C++ classes. Duplicating that work in Java
  for direct database access will be a pain.</li>

  <li>for future applications, distributed environment is envisioned. XML-RPC
  calls can be nicely tunneled through HTTP, which is not a case for JDBC.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If we found out that using XML-RPC significantly slow down interface, we will
move to direct JDBC calls, using some nifty features of Java/Tomcat (connection pool,..).
