RTS2 database tables
====================

RTS2 database is created by scripts run by rts2/src/sql/rts2-builddb. This
builddb script creates all base tables. It also runs various update scripts to
update tables to newer version of database - this is usefull on sites which
already run RTS2 and needs upgrade to new database structure. Those scripts are
located in rts2/src/sql/update directory.
