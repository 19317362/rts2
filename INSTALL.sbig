Instructions to install SBIG CCDs
=================================

You will need SBIG Linux driver. You can currenly download driver only from the
SBIG ftp site:

ftp://ftp.sbig.com/pub/devsw/LinuxDevKit.tar.gz 

Follow instructions in distribution file to setup udev to firmware loading. You can install fxload with

sudo apt-get install fxload

in Ubuntu/Debian.

Check that the sbigudrv.h file contains:

 #define TARGET                 ENV_LINUX                   /* Set for your target */

if TARGET is defined to some other environment, please change it.

Libusb development files need to be installed. On Ubuntu/Debian machine, that's:

sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

You then add to ./configure call:

--with-sbig-include=<path_to_the_directory_with_includes> --with-sbig-lib=<path_to_the_directory_with_libs>

Assuming you are compilling for x86 (64bit) architecture, and you extract LinuxDevKit to /home/sbig, the arquments will be following:

--with-sbig-include=/home/sbig/LinuxDevKit/x86/c/testapp --with-sbig-lib=/home/sbig/LinuxDevKit/x86/c/lib64

You can use --serial-number argument to rts2-camd-sbig to distinguish between multiple cameras by serial
number.
