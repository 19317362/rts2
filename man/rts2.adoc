# tag::optiongnu[]
RTS2 follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`--').  A summary of options is included below.

You can use -- (two dashes with space) to escape arguments which start with
'-'. So to run command with -1 as an argument, you must specify -- -1 on
the command line.
