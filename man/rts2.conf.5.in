.SH NAME
Remote Telescope System 2 configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION

This is configuration file of RTS2. It's usually located under
@PREFIX@etc/rts2.conf.  In this file blank lines are ignored. Comments starts
with \fB#\fP and continue to end of line.  Spaces are (unless they are in "")
ignored.

Values are typed as \fBname_of_value = value\fP. If value is real number, it's
understand by config as real number and as such is stored for futher use. So if
you type something like:

.RS
.B
my_string_value = 100.0
.RE

RTS2 understant that as float value and calls to get string from that value
will fail. You have to type \fBmy_string_value = "100.0"\fP to get it as string.

Values can have device prefix, separated with "\fB.\fP" RTS2 search first for
device-specific value. If it cannot find that, it will try to search common
value, e.g. value without device prefix.

For example, let's have that:

.RS
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
\fBflip = 1\fP@# since most of optics flip the image
\fBC0.flip = 0\fP@# but C0 is so special, that we don't have flip on it
.TE
.RE

Then \fBC0\fP flip will be \fB0\fP, and \fBC1\fP flip (since it's not entered)
will be \fB1\fP.

.SH Common options

The file have following common, device-unspecifics entries:

.SS astrometry
Specify script to launch for astrometry. String ? will be replaced with image
name. Image name is given without full path, astrometry is launched from
directory with that image.

.SS telescope_name
Specified default telescope name for planner to use. Most probably it will be
removed in future.

.SS group
Specify group to use for storing images. If that group doesn't exists, image
group isn't changes.  All users which run rts2 should be members of that group,
so they will be able to create new images.

.SS longtitude
Specify site longtitude in degrees. Values west of Greenwich are positive, east
of Greensich are negative. Value should be between -360.0 and +360.0.
Longtitude is used mainly for centrald calculation of sun azimuth and altitude
for state transitions.

.SS latitude
Specify site latitude in degrees. Positive values are for northern hemisphere,
negative values should be used in southern hemisphere. Please keep in mind,
that althought RTS2 is designed to be used on both hemispheres, it wasn't
tested till now at the southern hemisphere.

.SH "Centrald state transitions customization"

.SS day_horizont
That value tell centrald, when trasition from \fBEVENING\fP to \fBDUSK\fP and
from \fBDAWN\fP to \fBMORNING\fP occurs. It's altitude of the Sun above
horizont. Centrald is in \fBDUSK\fP or \fBDAWN\fP state, when Sun altitude is
below that value. Please refer to centrald states sections to learn more about
states.

.SS night_horizont
When sun altitute is below that value, night observations can be performed.
Ussually you will want to input there something between -6 and -12, depending
on yours optics, altitude, light pollution and other factors.

.SS evening_time
Duration of \fBEVENING\fP state. It's in seconds. You will have there something
like \fI3600\fP to \fI7200\fP, depending on you cooling system profile.

.SS morning_time
Duration of \fBMORNING\fP state. It's again in seconds. You will have there
something like \fI1800\fP (half an hour should be sufficient to let cameras
heat up).

.SH GRBC section

That section configures features of grbc - GammaRayBurst receiving client. For
detail explanation, please see \fBrts2-grbc(1)\fP man page.

.SS grbc.iban
Should iban reports be received? If yes, \fBY\fP or \fBy\fP should be type, any
other value means no.

.SS grbc.bacodine
Should GCN socket connection be enabled? If yes, you should type \fBY\fP or
\fBy\fP. That requires direct, not firewalled Internet connection. Please see
\fBhttp://gcn.gscf.nasa.gov\fP for details how to arrange such connection.

.SS grbc.bacoclient
Should bacoclient receiving enabled? Bacoclient requires bacofwd running on
host with direct connection. Bacoclient reverse sense of GCN connection, and
enables grbc to act as client (opossite to acting as server when bacodine is
enabled).  That for example enables you to connect throught proxy.

.SS bacodine.port
Port on which bacodine server will listen (local server, when bacodine option
is enabled). You should pass that port number to GCN people when you ask for
GCN socket connection.

.SS bacoclient.port
Port, on which bacofwd is listening for your client requests.

.SS bacoclient.server
Address of computer, running bacofwd.

.SS bacoclient.proxy
Will bacoclient connect throught proxy? If yes, you should enter username and
password for proxy connection.

.SS bacoclient.user
User name for proxy validation.

.SS bacoclient.password
Password for proxy connection.

.SS bacoclient.proxy_end
Message that proxy writes when login proceed and it opens connection to the
host.
.SH "Planc section"

Tells planc how to select next targets. That's still work in progress, so
please read carefully selector.ec code to get started.

.SS planc_selector
Which selector to use. Currently 4 different kind of selectors are possible:

.RS
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
\fB1\fR \fISELECTOR_AIRMASS\fP@select targets only around predefined altitude.
\fB2\fR \fISELECTOR_ALTITUDE\fP@select targets which are nearby selected altitude.
\fB3\fR \fISELECTOR_HETE\fP@select HETE fields (antisolar point).
\fB4\fR \fISELECTOR_GPS\fP@select targets with type 'G' - Galactic Plane Survey.
.TE
.RE

For details, please see \fBrts2-planc(5)\fP. Number value is expected here, so
you should write
.I planc_selector = 1
when you wants SELECTOR_AIRMASS.

.SS dark_horizont
Tell when at dusk or dawn rts2-planc should stop taking darks for flat fields,
and start to take flat-fields. That will occur, when Sun altitute is equal that
value.

.SS dark_frequency
Every n-th picture will be dark. So if you write here \fB20\fP, you will get 19
light images and 1 dark image.

.SS hete.frequency
Configures \fBFSELECTOR_HETE\fP. Specifies how often scheduler should select
HETE target.  If you put \fB2\fP here, you will get every second field pointing
to HETE.

.SS gps.frequency
Configures \fBSELECTOR_GPS\fP. Specifies how often scheduler should choose one
of \fI'I'\fP targets. For example, if you would like to have only GPS running,
put \fI1\fP here.  If you would like to reserver for GPS every 5th exposure
time (every 5th picture will be GPS picture), put \fI5\fP here.

.SS gps.interval
Configures \fBSELECTOR_GPS\fP. Specifies how much time you would like to have
between GPS exposures. For example, if you would like to have at least 3 and
half days between succesion GPS images, write here 302400. Be aware, that that
value is in \fBseconds\fP!

.SH Cameras section

Describes, which informations should be added to FITS header for cameras. We
originally thing, that we will handle that in cameras configuration. But as
it's easier to restart one planc process then dozens of cameras processes, we
decide to put it to global configuration file.

Entries are generall, common, without device prefix, and device-prefixed. We
will describes only unprefixed case, leaving on reader to figure-out, how to
use prefixed case (hint: use device name as prefix)

.SS flip
Describes, if image is fliped. It's quite common feature of astronomical
optics, that it flip the image.  If it does so, you should entry here 1. If it
doesn't flip the image, you should entry here 0.

.SS rotang
Rotational angle of camera. Used by astrometry as first estimate of camera
rotation angle.

.SS xplate, yplate
X dimension and Y dimension of one pixel. Given in arcseconds per pixel.

.SS filter
Camera filter. String, describing filter beeing used. Database entry is limited
to 8 characters.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
