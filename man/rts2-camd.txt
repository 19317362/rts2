RTS2-CAMD(7)
============

NAME
----

rts2-camd - generic manual page for camera drivers.

SYNOPSIS
--------

*rts2-camd-'camera driver'* [--focdev 'focuser name'] [--wheeldev 'filter wheel'] [-e 'default exposure'] [-s 'hostname[:port]'] [--modefile 'filename'] [-d 'device name'] [--detsize 'x:y:w:h'] [--filter-offsets 'fo1:fo2:..'] [--offsets-file 'filename']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This manual page describes camera drivers available in RTS2, and common
options for camera driver. For description of options common to all
devices, please consult linkman:rts2-device[7].

SPECIFYING ARRANGEMENT OF MULTI CHANNEL DETECTORS
------------------------------------------------

Camera driver can specify variables which are transformed into description of how a channel in multi-channel
device is oriented on screen. It is safe to ignore the further description for a single channel device.

Channel orientation is specified by its starting point in XY detector coordinates, and its deltas, e.g. ratio
and orientation of detector pixels to channel pixels. Please note that the current model allows only for
channels axis aligned with detector axis. Assuming the 4 channel 1000x1000 detector, with readout amplifiers (=
first pixel of the image) on locations marked with +, as depicted on the next graphics:

----
  +------|------+
  |      |      |
  |  4   |   3  |
  |      |      |

  |      |      |
  |  1   |   2  |

the following arguments should be supplied to rts2-camd (preferably in /etc/rts2/devices):
**--detsize 0:0:2000:2000 --chanstarts 0:0,2000:0,2000:2000,0:2000 --chandeltas 1:1,-1:1,-1:-1,1:-1**.

Please note this only adds certain keywords to FITS header. This does not
change axis orientation of the recorded data.

OPTIONS
-------

* **--wheeldev** name of attached (external) filter wheel device

* **--focdev** name of attached (external) focuser device

* **--filter-offsets** filter offsets. Offsets are specified in filter order
  (see -f option), and applicable only if camera has either embedded filter
  wheel, or a wheel is attached to camera using **--wheeldev** option. And of
  course you need to add focuser with **--focdev** option.

* **--offsets-file** file with filter offsets. Line in the file represents one
  entry, and consists of filter name and offset (in focuser steps). Lines
  starting with # are ignored.  Applicable only when **--focdev** and
  **--wheeldev** are provided.

Example filter offset file:

----
# Simple filter offset file
# R filter, -200 steps
R -200
# B filter, +20 steps
B 20
